# Data Structures

Implementation of the fundamental data structures and algorithms in Java through a console application.

## Motivation

This project was created to learn and implement different data structures in Java.

## Singly linked list

***Bakery application*** of singly linked list data structure:

 * app package:
      * Bakery class
      * Baker class
      * Customer class
      * Main class
 * list package:
      * List interface
      * SinglyLinkedList class

***Features of Bakery application:***
  
  As a *baker*:
  * See what kind of cookies are on the menu
  * See the cookies, which are ready to eat
  * See the number of finished cookies
  * Add a new finished cookie at the beginning of the table
  * Add a new finished cookie at the end of the table
  * Add a new finished cookie at a specific point of the table
  * Replace a new finished cookie with another finished cookie on the table
  * See which cookie is at a specific point of the table
  * Find the first occurrence (place) of a specific cookie on the table
  * See if a specific cookie is finished already
  * Clear the cookies from the table

  As a *customer*:
  * See what kind of cookies are on the menu
  * See the cookies, which are ready to eat
  * Take away a finished cookie from the beginning of the table
  * Take away a finished cookie from the end of the table
  * Take away a finished cookie from a specific point of the table
  * See if a specific cookie is finished already
  * Take away all of the cookies from the table

## TO DO

Implement other data structures, such as Vector, Stack, ArrayList, etc.
